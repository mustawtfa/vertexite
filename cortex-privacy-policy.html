    <h1>Cortex Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center; font-style: italic;">Last Updated: July 19, 2025</p>


    <!-- Section: Introduction and Acceptance of Terms -->
    <p>
      Welcome to Cortex. The Cortex application and related services ("Service") are provided by the individual
      developers known as <strong>Vertex</strong> ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains the specific data
      practices for the Cortex Service and supplements the general <strong><a
          href="https://vertexishere.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vertex Privacy
          Policy</a></strong>, which applies to the entire Vertex ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document should be read in conjunction with the general Vertex policy and our <strong><a
          href="https://vertexishere.com/cortex-terms-of-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cortex Terms
          of Service</a></strong>. By using the Service, you acknowledge and agree to the data practices described in
      these documents. An account created for Cortex is a unified Vertex Account, usable across our ecosystem of apps
      and games.
    </p>

    <h2>A) Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information in a few different ways to provide and improve our services:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Information You Provide Directly:</b> To create and manage your Vertex Account, we collect your
        <strong>username</strong>, <strong>email address</strong>, and a <strong>password</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Information from Third-Party Services (e.g., Google Sign-In):</b> You may have the option to create or
        access
        your account through a third-party service like <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a>. When you do so, you authorize us to receive certain
        information from that service's platform. This may include your <strong>name, email address, profile
          picture,</strong> and a unique identifier associated with your account. We use this information to create
        and
        populate your Vertex Account. The specific information we receive is determined by your privacy settings on
        that
        service and the permissions you grant during the sign-in process.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Subscription and Payment Status:</b> If you subscribe to a paid tier, our payment processors (like <a
          href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RevenueCat</a>
        and the relevant app store) will collect and process information necessary to manage your subscription. We
        only
        receive a confirmation of your subscription status and do not store your full payment details.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Conversation Data:</b> This includes your prompts and AI responses. The handling of this data is strictly
        determined by your choice of an online or offline model.
      </li>
      <li><b>Technical and Device Information:</b> To ensure our service runs securely and correctly, we or our
        partners
        (like
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firebase</a>)
        automatically collect technical data when you connect to the Service. This includes your <strong>IP
          address</strong>, <strong>device type</strong> and identifiers, <strong>operating system version</strong>,
        and
        <strong>crash reports</strong>. This information is fundamental for security, bug fixing, and enabling core
        application features.
      </li>
      <li><b>Usage and Interaction Data:</b> To understand, improve, and secure our Service, we collect data about
        your
        interaction with the application's features. For instance, to manage service resources and prevent abuse, we
        track
        metrics associated with your account, such as the <strong>number of characters generated</strong> or
        <strong>requests
          made</strong>, which helps us enforce feature usage limits. This interaction data is used for our internal
        analytics
        to identify usage trends and enhance user experience. It is processed in a pseudonymous manner, is never
        used to
        personally identify you, and is <strong>always kept separate from the content of your private
          conversations.</strong>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>B) How We Use and Share Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect primarily to provide, maintain, and secure our services. This includes
      authentication, enabling features, and communicating with you. More specifically:</p>

    <h4>1. Offline Models: Privacy and Safety</h4>
    <p>
      When you use an offline model, we are committed to providing the highest level of privacy. However, to ensure
      a safe
      user experience, we have implemented a hybrid approach:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Core Conversation Privacy:</b> The core processing of your conversation data (your prompts and the AI's
        responses) happens <strong>entirely on your own device.</strong> This sensitive content is never transmitted
        to our
        servers or any third-party.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>On-Device Safety Moderation:</b> To prevent the generation of harmful content even in offline mode, the
        app
        periodically connects to <strong>Google Firebase</strong> (when an internet connection is available) to
        download an
        updated set of moderation rules (e.g., a list of prohibited words or patterns).
        <ul>
          <li style="margin-top:10px;">
            This connection <strong>only fetches the safety rules; it does not transmit the content of your private
              conversations.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            The actual safety check is then performed <strong>locally on your device</strong> using these downloaded
            rules.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This approach allows us to ensure a secure and responsible environment while keeping the content of your
      personal
      conversations private and on your device.
    </p>

    <h4>2. Online Model Data Flow and Moderation</h4>
    <p>When you use an online model, your data (prompts and images) undergoes a multi-step process designed for
      safety
      and
      functionality:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Step 1: Automated Safety Review:</b> Your content is first sent to our partners, such as <strong><a
            href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI</a>
          (GPT-4o and Moderation models)</strong>, for an automated check against their safety policies. This is a
        crucial step
        to
        filter out inappropriate or harmful content before it is processed further.</li>
      <li><b>Step 2: Secure Relay to AI Provider:</b> Content that passes the safety review is then securely relayed
        through
        our infrastructure on <strong><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare</a></strong> to <strong><a href="https://openrouter.ai/privacy"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenRouter</a></strong>, which routes it to the final
        AI
        provider you selected (e.g., <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthropic</a>, <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a>).</li>
      <li><b>Our Data Handling Promise:</b> Our system is designed as a secure relay. <strong>We do not permanently
          store
          the content of your conversations or images on our servers after the request is completed.</strong> The
        primary
        purpose of this flow is to provide the service securely and safely.</li>
      <li><b>Third-Party Responsibility:</b> Your data is subject to the privacy policies of
        <strong><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare</a></strong>,
        <strong><a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://openrouter.ai/privacy"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenRouter</a></strong>, and the final AI provider. We
        strongly
        advise you to
        review
        their policies to understand how they handle your data.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. The Vertex Ecosystem and Data Separation</h4>
    <p>Your Vertex Account allows for a seamless experience across our products. However, we maintain strict data
      separation. <strong>Your activity, conversations, and technical data from Cortex are never used to track you
        or
        personalize your experience (e.g., show ads) in other Vertex apps or games.</strong></p>

    <h4>4. Handling of User Reports and Content Moderation</h4>
    <p>
      To ensure the safety and integrity of our Service, we provide an in-app tool for you to report content you
      believe
      violates our policies. When you submit a report, we collect specific data for the sole purpose of
      investigating
      the issue, enforcing our Terms of Service, and improving our AI safety mechanisms. The information we collect
      includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Reported Content (messageText):</strong> The full text of the AI-generated message you are
        reporting. We may
        also collect a few preceding messages from the conversation to provide essential context for our review.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Your Feedback (description & subject):</strong> This includes the report category you select from
        the
        provided options (the 'subject') and any additional text or description you choose to provide.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Account Information (reporterUid):</strong> Your unique user identifier. We require this to process
        the
        report, to prevent spam or abuse of the reporting system, and to maintain the integrity of our moderation
        process.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Technical Details (modelId & timestamp):</strong> The identifier of the AI model that generated the
        content and the precise timestamp of when the report was submitted. This helps us identify and resolve
        issues
        with specific models or at specific times.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data is handled with strict confidentiality and is used exclusively for content moderation and service
      improvement. It is never used for advertising, user profiling, or any other purpose unrelated to maintaining a
      safe and functional environment.
    </p>

    <h2>C) Your Rights and Data Control</h2>
    <p>You are in full control of your data.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Choice of Privacy:</strong> You can always choose <strong>offline models</strong> for maximum
        privacy.
      </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>D) Transparency and Open Source</h2>
    <p>We are committed to full transparency. The Cortex application is <strong>open source</strong>. We encourage
      you
      to review our code on GitHub to see exactly how your data is handled.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>GitHub Project:</b> <a href="https://github.com/VertexCorporation/Cortex" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/VertexCorporation/Cortex</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>E) Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our services are not directed to or intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. In alignment with
      our
      Google Play Store target audience declaration, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children
      under 13.</p>
    <p>If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, we will
      take
      immediate steps to delete that information from our systems. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your
      child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take action.</p>

    <h2>F) Security</h2>
    <p>We and our partners use industry-standard security measures. However, no method of transmission or storage is
      100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>G) Limitation of Liability</h2>
