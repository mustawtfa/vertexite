    <h1>Cortex Terms of Service</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center; font-style: italic;">Last Updated: August 25, 2025</p>


    <!-- Section: Introduction and Acceptance of Terms -->
    <p>
      Welcome to Cortex. The Cortex application and related services (collectively, the "Service") are provided by the
      individual developers known as <strong>Vertex</strong> ("we," "us," or "our"). These Terms of Service ("Terms")
      govern your access to and use of the Cortex Service specifically.
    </p>
    <p>
      These Terms supplement and are incorporated by reference into the general <strong><a
          href="https://vertexishere.com/terms-of-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vertex Terms of
          Service</a></strong>, which govern the entire Vertex ecosystem. By creating an account or using our Service,
      you agree to be bound by both these Cortex-specific Terms, the general Vertex Terms, and the <strong><a
          href="https://vertexishere.com/cortex-privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cortex Privacy
          Policy</a></strong>.
    </p>



    <!-- Section 1: The Service -->
    <h2>1. The Service</h2>
    <p>Cortex provides access to a variety of third-party artificial intelligence models for conversational purposes.
      The Service is offered through both free and paid tiers. Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on
      your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms.</p>

    <!-- Section 2: Account Responsibilities -->
    <h2>2. Your Vertex Account</h2>
    <p>You must create a Vertex Account to use most features of Cortex. You are responsible for all activities that
      occur under your account and for keeping your password confidential and secure. You agree to notify us immediately
      of any unauthorized use of your account.</p>

    <!-- Section 3: Financial Terms -->
    <h2>3. Subscriptions, Credits, and Payments</h2>
    <p>
      Cortex may offer paid subscriptions and a digital credit system ("Credits") to access premium features or online
      models. <strong>Credits are specifically required to interact with online AI models.</strong> All financial
      transactions are processed through third-party payment gateways like the Google Play Store or
      Apple App Store.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Subscriptions:</strong> Subscriptions are billed in advance on a recurring basis (e.g., monthly or
        yearly).
        They will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel them through your account
        settings
        or the relevant app store's subscription management tools.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Credits:</strong> Credits are the digital currency used for online model interactions.
        <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
          <li>The cost of sending messages or including images is denominated in Credits. <strong>The specific cost for
              each action is displayed within the application interface (e.g., next to the send button) before you
              confirm the action.</strong></li>
          <li>Users on the free plan may receive a daily bonus of promotional Credits. <strong>The amount of this bonus
              and its terms are specified within the app and are subject to change at our discretion.</strong></li>
          <li>Credits are a digital commodity for use only within the Service. They have no cash value, are not
            redeemable for cash, and cannot be transferred between users or accounts.</li>
          <li><strong>Upon termination of your account for any reason, all unused Credits will be forfeited and you will
              not be entitled to any compensation or refund.</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Creator Support Program:</strong>
        <p style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
          The Service includes a Creator Support Program that allows you to support content creators ("Creators") by
          using their unique code ("Creator Code"). By participating, you agree to the following terms:
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
          <li>
            <strong>How it Works:</strong> When you enter a valid Creator Code, it becomes active on your account. For
            subsequent eligible purchases of Subscriptions or Credits, a portion of the net revenue from your purchase
            will be attributed to the supported Creator. <strong>Using a Creator Code does not change the price you
              pay.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>One Creator at a Time:</strong> You may only have one active Creator Code on your account at any
            given time. Entering a new Creator Code will automatically replace and deactivate any previously active
            code.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Commission and Program Changes:</strong> The specific percentage, amount, or value of the support
            attributed to a Creator (the "Commission") from your purchases is determined solely by Vertex. <strong>We
              reserve the right to change the Commission rates, modify the terms of the Creator Support Program, or
              discontinue the program entirely at any time, at our sole discretion, and without prior notice to you or
              the Creator.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Payout Terms:</strong> The timing and frequency of payouts for accrued Commissions to Creators are
            at Vertex's sole discretion. Payments are not guaranteed to be monthly and may be subject to minimum payout
            thresholds, verification processes, or other operational requirements.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pricing and Refund Policy:</strong> <strong>We reserve the right to change the pricing for
          Subscriptions and Credits at any time.</strong> Due to the immediate and digital nature of our services, all
        purchases for
        subscriptions and Credits are considered final and non-refundable, except as required by applicable law or the
        terms of
        the platform through which the purchase was made (e.g., Google Play Store, Apple App Store).
      </li>
    </ul>



    <!-- Section 4: User Obligations -->
    <h2>4. User Conduct and Content Policy</h2>
    <p>
      You are solely responsible for your conduct and any content you submit or generate using the Service ("User
      Content"),
      <strong>which includes both the messages in your conversations and the custom AI models you
        create.</strong>
      To maintain a safe and respectful environment, especially considering our diverse user base which includes younger
      audiences, you agree not to use the Service for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited by these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      To enforce these rules, we employ safety mechanisms for both online and offline models. For <strong>online
        models</strong>, your inputs and <strong>custom model configurations</strong> may be submitted to automated
      content moderation services like <strong>OpenAI's
        Moderation API</strong>. For <strong>offline models</strong>, the app performs a similar check locally on your
      device using a set of rules periodically downloaded from our servers, as detailed in our Privacy Policy. In both
      cases, these checks are automated and designed to prevent the generation of harmful content. You agree that you
      will
      not generate or disseminate User Content that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Is Sexually Explicit or Pornographic:</strong> Includes any form of pornography, nudity with sexual
        intent,
        or content intended for sexual gratification.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Involves Self-Harm:</strong> Encourages or provides instructions on how to self-harm or commit suicide.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Is Hateful or Discriminatory:</strong> Promotes hate speech, harassment, or violence against individuals
        or
        groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other protected
        characteristics.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Is Illegal or Promotes Illegal Acts:</strong> Depicts or facilitates illegal activities, such as drug
        creation, theft, or terrorism.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Infringes on Privacy or Intellectual Property:</strong> Violates someone's privacy or infringes on
        copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Is Malicious:</strong> Attempts to generate malware, viruses, phishing schemes, or otherwise disrupt the
        security of any service or individual.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor, filter, and remove User Content that we determine, in
      our
      sole discretion, violates these Terms or is otherwise harmful to our Service or our users. We may also suspend or
      terminate your account for violations of this policy.
    </p>

    <p>
      We empower our users to help us maintain a safe and responsible environment. If you encounter any AI-generated
      content that you believe violates our policies or is otherwise harmful, you agree to report it. You can do this
      by using the <strong>in-app reporting feature</strong>, which is accessed by long-pressing the specific
      message in a conversation. When you submit a report, you acknowledge that this action will transmit the necessary
      data for our review. The specific details of the data collected during this process are outlined in the "Handling
      of User Reports and Content Moderation" section of our <strong><a
          href="https://vertexishere.com/cortex-privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy
          Policy</a></strong>. We are committed to investigating these reports promptly to take appropriate action.
    </p>


    <!-- Section 5: Disclaimer for AI Content (Critical) -->
    <div class="critical-disclaimer">
      <p><strong>The Service provides access to experimental AI technologies. Your use of these features is entirely at
          your own risk.</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No Guarantees:</strong> We do not guarantee the accuracy, relevance, safety, or appropriateness of
          any content generated by the AI models. This content may be incorrect, biased, offensive, or otherwise
          harmful.</li>
        <li><strong>Character Models:</strong> Some models are presented as "Characters" configured by Vertex. While we
          provide the personality layer (system prompt), the core intelligence and generative capabilities are powered
          by third-party models via OpenRouter. <strong>The developers of Vertex</strong> are not the creators of the
          underlying AI and disclaim all responsibility for its outputs.</li>
        <li><strong>No Professional Advice:</strong> Content generated by the AI is for informational and entertainment
          purposes only. It does not constitute, and should not be used as a substitute for, professional advice (e.g.,
          medical, legal, or financial advice). Always consult a qualified professional.</li>
        <li><strong>Your Responsibility:</strong> You are solely responsible for your use of the generated content and
          for any decisions or actions you take based on it.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      While we implement automated safety filters and establish clear content policies, you acknowledge that generative
      AI is an evolving technology and may, in rare and unintended instances, produce outputs that are inconsistent with
      our policies. We are committed to continuously improving our safety mechanisms and promptly addressing any
      reported issues to mitigate such occurrences.

    <!-- Section 6: Intellectual Property and Third-Party Licenses -->
    <h2>6. Intellectual Property and Third-Party Licenses</h2>
    <p>
